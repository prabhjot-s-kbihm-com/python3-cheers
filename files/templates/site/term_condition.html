		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on which hosting plan you choose, you may request to change
 the billing term of your hosting service through your account control 
panel.  
			In such cases, the expiry date of your hosting service will be 
adjusted according to the billing term that you have requested.  Any 
optional 
			features for your hosting plan will be billed according to the term 
that you have requested.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your hosting plan includes a free domain name, you will be 
required to pay a fee to reimburse Website.com for the domain name 
registration 
			upon changing to another hosting plan or a billing term that does not
 include a free domain name.  The amount of this fee will vary depending
 on 
			the domain extension and on the registration term.
		</p>
		<p>
			All Website.com web hosting services, including service trials and 
promotional hosting offers, and their billing terms may be prorated and 
adjusted 
			to expire on the last day of a month.
		</p>
		<p>
			All service trials and promotion offers are considered to be 
delivered in full upon the completion of the service term stated on the 
trial or offer 
			invoice found in your account control panel.  Website.com is not 
obligated to provide reimbursement for any proration or service term 
adjustment on service 
			trials or promotional offers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Promotional offers, including special introductory rates, promotional
 rates, or any non-regular pricing, are only available to new customers 
and 
			are only valid for the initial term.  All hosting services will renew
 at the regular renewal rate.

			In the absence of a cancellation request from you, your hosting 
service will be renewed for a successive term, at the regular renewal 
rate, on the 
			16th of the expiry month.
